- Implemetation:
With the focus on rigid body dynamics, there have been mainly numerous well-established open source physics engines available on xxx. TBA

- Rendering engine:
Rendering engines are also very helpful in debugging and determining the success of the physics engine by visualizing the output results, and the main one is Blender. TBA

- Analysis:
Standards on analyzing quanlitative results for comparing physics engines are also published such as xxx.

Preparation

Background Theory

1. Defining state space (use a vector of positions, velocity and rotation to represent the state of a rigid body)

2. Establish motion equation, i.e. use the force to compare derivative of state space to itself, then solve the equation to compute the derivative

3. How to simulate: repeatedly advance the step proportional to the computed derivative
