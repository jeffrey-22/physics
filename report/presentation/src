Presentation
project checkers will arrange a session which is attended by all students in their project checker group (typically 8 to 10 people), and each member of the group will describe progress made so far in a 5-minute presentation to the whole group. This presentation should be carefully rehearsed.

Note that:

The use of slides projected from a laptop is encouraged.
No more than four slides can usefully be described in 5 minutes.
The presentation should summarise the progress report.  If the project is on track, then this will be a straightforward case of describing what has been achieved and key work remaining before starting to write up.  Where work is behind schedule, you should focus less on what the difficulties have been and more on what steps you are taking to address them so that you can still deliver a high-quality dissertation.
